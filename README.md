# envi_masterthesis
I am still a beginner in R but here is what I learned so far throughout the process of learning it for my master thesis

Using R vegan package for the statistical analysis and
ggplot for establishing the plot

This script is for ordination plots (multivariate statistics) to identify correlation between
species abundance identified by gene sequencing and the environmental variables measured. Customizable ordination plot using
ggplot package

Will update this repository soon when I finalized my other statistical tests
